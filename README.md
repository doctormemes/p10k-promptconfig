# p10k-promptconfig plugin

This plugin adds the ability to easily switch between Powerlevel10k prompt theme config files by defining the P10K_PROMPT variable in your .zshrc file.
If it cannot find the file, it will fallback to trying to use .p10k.zsh (the file generated by powerlevel10k's `p10k configure` command) and if it cannot find a .p10k.zsh file, it will ask if you'd like to run `p10k configure` to generate one.
Make sure whatever theme file you're using has a . in front of the name and the .zsh extension, like so:

**FILE NAME:**

.docstheme.zsh

**FILE LOCATION**

Unless you have $ZDOTDIR set and are using a custom directory for your Zsh dotfiles, place the theme file inside your user's home directory. If $ZDOTDIR is set, place it in the directory found in $ZDOTDIR.

**DEFINE THE P10K_PROMPT VARIABLE IN .zshrc:**

P10K_PROMPT="docstheme"

To use it, add `p10k-promptconfig` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... p10k-promptconfig)
```
